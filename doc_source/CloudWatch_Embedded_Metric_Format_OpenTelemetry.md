# Using the Embedded Metric Format with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry<a name="CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format_OpenTelemetry"></a>

You can use the embedded metric format as a part of the OpenTelemetry project\. OpenTelemetry is an open\-source initiative that removes boundaries and restrictions between vendor\-specific formats for tracing, logs, and metrics by offering a single set of specifications and APIs\. For more information, see [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)\.

Using embedded metric format with OpenTelemetry requires two components: an OpenTelemetry\-compliant data source, and the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector enabled for use with CloudWatch embedded metric format logs\. 

We have preconfigured redistributions of the OpenTelemetry components, maintained by AWS, to make onboarding as easy as possible\. For more information about using OpenTelemetry with embedded metric format, in addition to other AWS services, see [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry](https://aws-otel.github.io/)\.

For additional information regarding language support and usage, see [AWS Observability on Github](https://github.com/aws-observability)\.
