# Get CloudWatch metric statistics using an AWS SDK<a name="example_cloudwatch_GetMetricStatistics_section"></a>

The following code example shows how to get Amazon CloudWatch metric statistics\.

------
#### [ Python ]

**SDK for Python \(Boto3\)**  
  

```
class CloudWatchWrapper:
    """Encapsulates Amazon CloudWatch functions."""
    def __init__(self, cloudwatch_resource):
        """
        :param cloudwatch_resource: A Boto3 CloudWatch resource.
        """
        self.cloudwatch_resource = cloudwatch_resource

    def get_metric_statistics(self, namespace, name, start, end, period, stat_types):
        """
        Gets statistics for a metric within a specified time span. Metrics are grouped
        into the specified period.

        :param namespace: The namespace of the metric.
        :param name: The name of the metric.
        :param start: The UTC start time of the time span to retrieve.
        :param end: The UTC end time of the time span to retrieve.
        :param period: The period, in seconds, in which to group metrics. The period
                       must match the granularity of the metric, which depends on
                       the metric's age. For example, metrics that are older than
                       three hours have a one-minute granularity, so the period must
                       be at least 60 and must be a multiple of 60.
        :param stat_types: The type of statistics to retrieve, such as average value
                           or maximum value.
        :return: The retrieved statistics for the metric.
        """
        try:
            metric = self.cloudwatch_resource.Metric(namespace, name)
            stats = metric.get_statistics(
                StartTime=start, EndTime=end, Period=period, Statistics=stat_types)
            logger.info(
                "Got %s statistics for %s.", len(stats['Datapoints']), stats['Label'])
        except ClientError:
            logger.exception("Couldn't get statistics for %s.%s.", namespace, name)
            raise
        else:
            return stats
