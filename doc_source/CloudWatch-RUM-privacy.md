## CloudWatch RUM web client cookies<a name="CloudWatch-RUM-cookies"></a>

The CloudWatch RUM web client collects certain data about user sessions by default\. You can choose to enable cookies to have the web client also collect a user ID and session ID for each session\. The user ID is randomly generated by RUM\.

If these cookies are enabled, RUM is able to display the following types of data when you view the RUM dashboard for this app monitor\.
+ Aggregated data based on user IDs, such as number of unique users and the number of different users who experienced an error\. 
+ Aggregated data based on session IDs, such as number of sessions and the number of sessions that experienced an error\. 
+ The *user journey*, which is the sequence of pages that each sampled user session includes\. 

**Important**  
If you do not enable these cookies, the web client still records certain information about end user sessions such as browser type/version, operating system type/version, device type, and so on\. These are collected to provide aggregated page\-specific insights, such as web vitals, page views, and pages that experienced errors\. For more information about the data recorded, see [Information collected by the CloudWatch RUM web client](CloudWatch-RUM-datacollected.md)\.
