# Create projects, features, launches, and experiments<a name="CloudWatch-Evidently-projectsfeatures"></a>

To get started with CloudWatch Evidently, for either a feature launch or an A/B experiment, you first create a *project*\. A project is a logical grouping of resources\. Within the project, you create *features* that have variations that you want to test or launch\. You can create a feature either before you create a launch or experiment, or at the same time\.
