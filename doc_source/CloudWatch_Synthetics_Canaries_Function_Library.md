# Library functions available for canary scripts<a name="CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Function_Library"></a>

CloudWatch Synthetics includes several built\-in classes and functions that you can call when writing Node\.js scripts to use as canaries\.

Some apply to both UI and API canaries\. Others apply to UI canaries only\. A UI canary is a canary that uses the `getPage()` function and uses Puppeteer as a web driver to navigate and interact with webpages\.
