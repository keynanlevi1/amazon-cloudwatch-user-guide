# Prerequisites<a name="appinsights-prereqs"></a>

You must complete the following prerequisites to configure an application with CloudWatch Application Insights:
+ **AWS SSM enablement\. **You must install Systems Manager Agent \(SSM Agent\), and your instances must be enabled for SSM\. For information about how to install the SSM Agent, see [Setting Up AWS SSM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up.html)\.
+ **EC2 instance role\. **You must attach the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` role to enable Systems Manager \(see [Using Identity\-based Policies \(IAM Policies\) for AAWS SSM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-iam-identity-based-access-control.html)\) and the `CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy` to enable instance metrics and logs to be emitted through CloudWatch\. See [Create IAM Roles and Users for Use With CloudWatch Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create-iam-roles-for-cloudwatch-agent.html) for more information\.
+ **AWS resource groups\. **To onboard your applications to CloudWatch Application Insights, you must create a resource group that includes all associated AWS resources used by your application stack\. This includes application load balancers, EC2 instances running IIS and web front‐end, \.NET worker tiers, and your SQL Server database\. CloudWatch Application Insights automatically includes Auto Scaling groups using the same tags or CloudFormation stacks as your resource group, because Auto Scaling groups are not currently supported by resource groups\. For more information, see [Getting Started with AWS Resource Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/gettingstarted.html)\.
+ **IAM permissions: **For non‐admin users, you must create an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) policy that allows Application Insights to create a service\-linked role, and attach it to your user identity\. For steps on attaching the policy, see [IAM policy](appinsights-iam.md)\.
+ **Service\-linked role: **CloudWatch Application Insights uses AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) service‐linked roles\. A service‐linked role is created for you when you create your first CloudWatch Application Insights application in the AWS Management Console\. For more information, see [Using service\-linked roles for CloudWatch Application Insights](CHAP_using-service-linked-roles-appinsights.md)\.
+ **Performance Counter metrics support for EC2 Windows instances:** To monitor Performance Counter metrics on your EC2 Windows instances, Performance Counters must be installed on the instances\. For Performance Counter metrics and corresponding Performance Counter set names, see [Performance Counter metrics](application-insights-performance-counter.md)\. For more information about Performance Counters, see [Performance Counters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/perfctrs/performance-counters-portal)\.
