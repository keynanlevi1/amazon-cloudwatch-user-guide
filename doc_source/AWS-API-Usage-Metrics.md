# AWS API usage metrics<a name="AWS-API-Usage-Metrics"></a>



Most APIs that support AWS CloudTrail logging also report usage metrics to CloudWatch\. API usage metrics in CloudWatch allow you to proactively manage API usage by visualizing metrics in the CloudWatch console, creating custom dashboards, detecting changes in activity with CloudWatch Anomaly Detection, and configuring alarms that alert when usage approaches a threshold\.

The following table lists the services that report API usage metrics to CloudWatch, and the value to use for the `Service` dimension to see the usage metrics from that service\.

Some services report usage metrics for additional APIs as well\. To see whether an API reports usage metrics to CloudWatch, use the CloudWatch console to see the metrics reported by that service in the `AWS/Usage` namespace\.

**To see the list of a service's APIs that report usage metrics to CloudWatch**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**\.

1. On the **All metrics** tab, choose **Usage**, and then choose **By AWS Resource**\.

1. In the search box near the list of metrics, enter the name of the service\. The metrics are filtered by the service you entered\.
